### Hey there!  
My name is Robin Hundt and this is my first ever blog post. After finishing my bachelor in computer science at the University of Göttingen, I moved to Darmstadt a couple of moths ago (just at the start of the pandemic, yay...) to continue my master studies in computer science at the technical university there.  
I've long toyed with the idea of having my own blog and now I have some free time to set one up and write some posts!  

#### About me
I started my bachelor in CS in october 2016 at the University of Göttingen. During my time there I was part of the student representatives ([FSR](https://fsr.math-cs.uni-goettingen.de/)) from my second semester until I moved to Darmstadt in early 2020. My interests lie in computer science, specifically the Rust programming language, bouldering, hiking, general outdoorsy stuff, feminisim, board games, D&D, coffee and lots of other stuff.

#### This blog
I'm not yet sure what I will write about on this blog. Probably I'll start with some technical posts about multi-threading in Rust. This semester I attended a class on "Multi-Threading in C++" at uni, a course I enjoyed a lot, and whose concepts I'd like to write about in the context of Rust. So that's probably where I start.  
However I might also write about any of my other interests :)
